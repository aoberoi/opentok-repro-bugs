  <h1>Multiple Cameras Bug</h1>

  <p>
  There are two ways to get two camera's from the same client publishing into a session.
  The first is to connect to the session and call
  session.publish(replacedId, { cameraName : camera }). The second is to call
  TB.initPublisher(apiKey, replacedId, { cameraName : camera }) and then later call
  session.publish(publisher) for each of the previously returned publishers.
